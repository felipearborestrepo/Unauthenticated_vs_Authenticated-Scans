# Unauthenticated_vs_Authenticated-Scans

This project compares the results of **unauthenticated** and **authenticated** vulnerability scans performed on a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Azure.  
It demonstrates the critical importance of using authenticated scans to reveal deeper system vulnerabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Utilized
- **Tenable.io** ‚Äì Vulnerability scanning and management platform.
- **Azure Virtual Machines** ‚Äì Windows 10 VM for scanning and target testing.
- **Windows Firewall** ‚Äì Disabled for demonstration of unauthenticated scans.
- **PowerShell** ‚Äì For VM configuration and environment setup.

## üìù Phase 1: VM Creation and Environment Setup
‚úÖ **Created a Windows 10 VM** in Azure.  
![Created VM]![1- Created VM Windows 10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6ef14b-5b2e-4a85-9918-d00c37218091)


‚úÖ **Disabled Windows Firewall Inside VM** to allow scanning of internal services.

## üí¨ Group Meeting Chat
**Mock discussion to plan the next steps:**

> **Felipe (Security Engineer):** Hey team, I ran the unauthenticated scan on the VM and got six medium vulnerabilities, mostly around TLS, SSL, and SMB.  
> **John (SysAdmin):** That‚Äôs expected‚Äîno credentials means we miss local issues.  
> **Felipe:** Exactly. After enabling authenticated scans, I found 1 critical, 5 high, and 19 medium vulnerabilities.  
> **John:** Let‚Äôs prioritize critical and high findings for the next CAB meeting.  
> **Felipe:** Agreed! I‚Äôll prepare a remediation plan for those.

## üîç Comparison of Scan Results
| Metric                       | Unauthenticated Scan | Authenticated Scan |
|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Critical Vulnerabilities     | 0                    | 1                  |
| High Vulnerabilities         | 0                    | 5                  |
| Medium Vulnerabilities       | 6                    | 19                 |
| Low Vulnerabilities          | 1                    | 3                  |
| Info/Low-Level Findings      | 29                   | 136                |
| **Total Vulnerabilities**    | 36                   | 164                |

Authenticated scans provide a more accurate view of system vulnerabilities and should be prioritized in enterprise environments.
